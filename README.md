# CHIP-8 Emulator 

![](https://github.com/mtoso/chip8-emulator/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)

This package contains an interpreter for [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) written in Rust and compiled to wasm.

The syntax of the assembler and disassembler is based on the syntax described
in [Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference
v1.0](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM), by Thomas P. Greene

You can play with the interpreter in the browser here: https://mtoso.github.io/chip8-emulator/
